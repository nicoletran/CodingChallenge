Coding Challenge Section One: Net Gain Project

## Data Visualization
This notebook examines descriptive statistics and methods of visualization for advertising data including count plots and a correlation matrix as well as interpretations of corresponding visualizations. 

## Classification
Initial model is proposed with 77% accuracy in predicting advertising success (net gain). Proposed project will seek to examine feature importance to determine what advertising characteristics best predict product success. Findings can be used to inform advertising methodology.
